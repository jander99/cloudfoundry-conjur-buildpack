  # Its Complicated :D 
  # Buildpacks are in a huge state of flux. As of Spring 2019, buildpacks use the 
  # V2 apis, but the V3 is a fundamental change for the better, but it is a big change.
  # Couple that with the fact that the Java Buildpack is *HUGE*.  So what is happening is
  # the Java Buildpack is being deconstructed into multiple smaller java build pack 
  # that are more focused on individual problems. 

  # why does this matter? Because it is the final buildpacks whose job is to 
  # look through all the ./profile.d/ directories of all the dependencies and execute scripts. 
  # and the Java Buildpack v2 has not plans to implement this functionality.

  # https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack/issues/563#issuecomment-452437417

  # :(

  # so V2 supply buildpacks must *push* their scripts over into the /home/vcap/app/.profile.d/ 
  # directory. This is breaking of the build pack contract to manipulate anything inside /home/vcap/app
  # but at this point, you don't have much of a choice, all all this gets fixed in the V3 versions. 

  # /shrug.  

  # CONCERN: this following code, may only need to be executed *IF* the final build pack is java*
  # This will need to be heavily tested with multiple final buildpacks. 
  # or if the conjur-env runs twice is that a big deal? It will just 
  # set the env twice.  not good, but not terrible.

  echo "[cyberark-conjur-buildpack]:  - because of missing feature in Java Buildpack, also copy to /home/vcap/app/.profile.d/"
  mkdir -p $BUILD_DIR/.profile.d/

  # conjur-env reads a secrets.yml file and uses it to retrieve secrets from
  # Conjur. We copy it to the dependency directory to make it accessible to the
  # /profile.d script. The /vendor subdirectory is just for convenience.
  
  # note, the 0001_retrieve-secrets.sh script referenced:
  #   $DEPS_DIR/__BUILDPACK_INDEX__/vendor/conjur-env
  # so why are we copying it to a different directory below? 
  # commenting out to see if it breaks anything /shrug
